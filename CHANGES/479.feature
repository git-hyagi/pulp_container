Updated the image building feature:
    * Replaced `artifacts` by `build_context` (i.e., a file plugin repository version HREF)
    as the parameter to provide the build context for a Containerfile.
    * Added the `containerfile_name` as the parameter to provide the relative-path of a File Content
    from the provided `build_context`.
